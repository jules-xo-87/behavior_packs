MC Bedrock Behavior Pack

Changes include:
- Mob drops replace copper ore with diamond 
- Armour replace iron with diamond
- Tools replace iron with diamond
- Zombie variant mob drops replace rotten flesh with cooked beef
Note that the drop rates have not changed

Experimental mode:
- Using bridge replace diamond ore viens with custom diamond ore block that changes render method to be emissive and block light emissive. This is a test to see if overriding vanilla block properties works as expected
-
